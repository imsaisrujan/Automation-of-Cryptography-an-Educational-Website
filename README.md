## 📦 Installation & Setup

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/imsaisrujan/Automation-of-Cryptography-an-Educational-Website.git](https://github.com/imsaisrujan/Automation-of-Cryptography-an-Educational-Website.git)
    cd Automation-of-Cryptography-an-Educational-Website
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended for Python projects):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install backend dependencies (if applicable):**

    ```bash
    # Example for Python:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    # Example for Node.js (if your backend is Node.js and in a separate folder):
    # cd [backend_folder]
    # npm install
    ```

4.  **Install frontend dependencies (if applicable, e.g., React, Vue, or other build tools):**

    ```bash
    # Example for a frontend framework:
    # cd [frontend_folder]
    # npm install
    ```

5.  **[Optional: Database Setup/Migrations]**
    *If your project uses a database, you might need to perform migration steps here.*
    ```bash
    # Example for Flask-Migrate or Django migrations:
    # python [main_app_file].py db upgrade
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

To start the educational website:

1.  **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    # Example for Flask:
    python [main_app_file].py

    # Example for Node.js:
    # node [main_app_file].js
    ```

2.  **Start the frontend development server (if separate and required for development/build):**

    ```bash
    # Example if using a frontend build tool:
    # cd [frontend_folder]
    # npm start
    ```

3.  **Access the website:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:[YourPortNumber]`.
    *Common default ports include `5000` (Flask), `3000` (React dev server), `8000` (Django), or `8080`.*

**How to interact:**

* **[Briefly explain how a user would navigate the site and use its core features.]**
    * Example: "Select an algorithm (e.g., AES, RSA) from the navigation menu."
    * Example: "Input your text/key/parameters in the provided fields."
    * Example: "Click 'Encrypt' or 'Decrypt' to see the automated process and resulting output."
    * Example: "Explore the 'Concepts' section for theoretical explanations of each algorithm."
